##Make a class called User Create two attributes called first_name
##and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
##in a user profile Make a method called display_user() that prints a summary
##of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
##a personalized greeting to the user
##    - Create several instances representing different users, and
## call both methods for each user
##
##
##
##Write a method called increment_login_attempts() that increments the value of login_attempts by 1
##everytime login() method is called for the user. Write
##another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0
##Make an instance of the User class and call login() severl time to increment the counter using
##increment_login_attempts().. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
##properly, and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to mke sure it was reset to 0
##
##Create few users and list them in the order based on the first_name,
##second_name or age.
