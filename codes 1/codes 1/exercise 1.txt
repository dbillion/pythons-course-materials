implement the program(algorithm) from flow charts (folder). 

**Write code to display the factors of a number.(150 = 2.3.5.5)
Remember that the factors are only the prime numbers. 


**Write a function which takes an input n, say n= 100, and returns you the prime number until n. 


**The Fibonacci numbers are generated by setting F0=0, F1=1, and then using the formula
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
Write a program to generate Fibonacci series in reverse order from input n until 0.
