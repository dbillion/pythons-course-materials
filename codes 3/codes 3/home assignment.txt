Task 1:
------
(based on Lecture 2 + 3, i.e. file opening, reading and csv file reading and Lists, ofcoruse loops and conditions are also involved). 

You will read the csv file students.csv. It is list of all the students for a course, with their group id in the last column (for example iaib22, iaib21 and so on)
Your program should have following features;
1. upon execution after reading the csv file, it should give me all the group ids in a nice readable way (those students who are not part of any group, assign them group of 'open university')
2. secondly, within the execution, the program should ask me the which group I would like to see in detail, say I type iadb40 and it should return me names of all student in this group (in list from or simple output statments).  
3. after step 2, program should continue in the step 2, means I should be asked again after every group is displayed, which group I would like to see , and until i type 'q' then the program should quit. 
4. remember that I would like to enter case-insensitive group names so your program should handle both upper case and lower case letters without problem. 





Task 2:
------
develop your game Tic-Tac-Toe where two players can play against each other. Represent Tic-Tac-Toe Board with the dictionary. Each iteration the program should ask for player 1 input and then checks for winning then then ask for player 2 input and again checking for win condition. The game goes on until any player wins or the game is a tie. 

board should be mapped (and displayed) in the following pattren.

top-left | top-mid    | top-right
---------|------------|----------
mid-left |   mid      | mid-right
---------|------------|----------
low-left | low-mid    | mid-right
